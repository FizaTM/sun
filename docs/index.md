title: Sun Programming Language

# Sun

Sun is a programming language for quick prototyping and learning programming concepts. Being minimal and having a limited feature set, Sun is aimed to help novices in learning programming without all the cruft and redundancies. The language loosely follows the pseudocode language taught by Dr Juan in Sunway University for our Programming Concepts and Problem Solving class (PRG 1114).

The work for the programming language is just only at its beginning.

## How it looks

### Input / Output

```
Enter x
x = x + 1
Print x // 2
```

### If / Else
```
Enter x
If (x % 2 == 0) Then // if even
    Print "It's even!", x // notice the indentation
Else
    Print "It's odd!", x // notice the indentation
EndIf
```

### Automatic Loops
```
Loop:i=1 to 10
    Print i  // count from 1 - 10
EndLoop
```

### While Loops
```
i = 1
While i <= 10
	Print i  // count from 1 - 10
	i = i + 1
EndWhile
```

### Arrays
```
Loop:i=0 to 9
    Enter A[i]
EndLoop

Loop:i=0 to 9
    Print A[i]
EndLoop
```
